**Solution:** Refactored layout using Tailwind CSS's responsive classes and max-height logic inside flexbox containers.

**Challenge:** Navigating API rate limitations during map embedding.  
**Solution:** Capped usage in dev environment, switched to lazy loading and static pins during development.

**Challenge:** Responsive issues with embedded Google Maps on mobile layouts.  
**Solution:** Adjusted container styling and max-height constraints to ensure maps render properly across viewports.

**Challenge:** Design inconsistencies in header fonts and images across pages.  
**Solution:** Standardized typography and header image formatting for visual cohesion throughout the site.

**Challenge:** Managing scope creep and content redundancy.  
**Solution:** Removed unnecessary or duplicate content (Blueprint Builder) to maintain a focused user experience.
